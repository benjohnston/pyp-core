        <p>If someone asked you to describe prosperity and security, what would you see in your mind’s eye? Is it finally taking that trip to Paris? A beachfront mansion? Or simply the joy of making your final mortgage payment and staying right where you
          are? In your fantasy are you piloting a new luxury car, a sailboat, or a bicycle?</p>
        <p>Too often, financial advisors jump right into the minutiae of investments, skipping over the deeper questions of what you really want from your money, both now and in the future. But in Picture Your Prosperity, Ellen Rogin and Lisa Kueng do the
          exact opposite. First they’ll help you figure out exactly what YOU need and want. Only then will they help you make the smart money decisions that can help turn your visions into reality.</p>
